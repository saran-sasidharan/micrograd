Backpropagation is the heart of neural network to find the weights which minimize the cost function. 

# Micrograd
Expression graph with forward and backward pass. During backward pass chain rule from calculus is applied.

Neural networks are just mathematical expressions.

In production, n dimension tensors are used instead of scalars for efficiency reason.
